# Super-Mario-Level
Recreation of the first level of the original Super Mario Bros

The entire application lives under the working_mario_game_V2.py file and requires files in the resources folder for the animations to work. 


Only the library Pycharm was used to display the animations in a window, everything else was created from scratch using python code.


The entire project consists of 1145 lines of code and counting, the project is 90% completes but playable with minor bugs and features to be added like power ups and option for a 2nd player
